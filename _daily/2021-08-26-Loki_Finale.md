* caught up with my old real estate agent
  * she did some sleuthing for me
* dropped by Safeway for groceries

  * ended on a cliffhanger :(
* chess against computer
* Bernice pushed back on interview training
* coding into the night
* helped Jackie with applications!
* made a smoothie
* finished the morphy saga by Agadmator
  * more satisfying conclusion than Loki ...

TODAY:
* head to work
* Jackie watched a movie called Wish Dragon with her friends
  * apparently it was sub-par
* supposed to pick up Oren's on the way back
  * somehow Doordash order was scheduled to be sent to the kitchen 40 minutes after I arrived

LEARNINGS:
