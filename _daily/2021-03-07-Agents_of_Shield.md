YESTERDAY:
* guitar lesson
* Jackie took another practice exam
  * needed silence for a few hours
  * tried to do laundry three times (machines were in-use or broken)
  * quick jog to the grocery store
* called the parents on the way home
  * apparently my grandma has higher priority talking to my parents
  * I was asked to call back later in the evening :P
* made a kielbasa pasta for dinner
  * lot of mushrooms
  * lots of kielbasa
* made an oxtail stew for next week!
* switched to PC for witcher 3, so much more responsive

TODAY:
* woke up rather late
* oxtail stew for lunch
  * not bad, but I ran out of tomatoes (ripe and canned)
  * also this uses the duck broth from ages ago, so we didn't add salt
* Jackie had an eye exam
* toilet cleansing time!
* also finally moved some boxes out from the center of our living room
* Jackie picked up an earl grey tea with pudding instead of boba
* ordered panda express for dinner

LEARNINGS:
* that orange chicken DOES have milk ...
  * forget if I knew that or not
* spent a while researching environmentally friendly alternatives to canned air dusters
