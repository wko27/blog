YESTERDAY:
* alarm at 2:30 am got snoozed
  * then missed it
* woke up at 4:30 am
* rushed to airport
* turns out the online check-in did not succeed
  * although we paid for a checked bag
  * also, they only allow checked bags 90 minutes before the flight departs
* got through security and immigration about 15 mins after boarding began
* flight itself was fine
  * little weird that they re-shuffled half the passengers before we took off
  * weight imbalance?
* on arrival, the bridge connecting the airport to the airplane was down
  * took 30 minutes for a maintenance tech to fix it
* lyft to office
* drove home
  * got a bit of gas
* took a nap
* cereal for a late lunch
* took some quarters from my dad to do laundry
* family call with Amy
* head to Asia Village for dinner
  * brisket clay pot and salt & pepper pork chop weren't as tasty this time
* head home and check flights to philly

TODAY:
* head to work
* need a break from my breaks
* relax back into work
* team dinner at sea pot!
  * think everybody enjoyed it
* head to workout immediately afterwards
  * deadlifts and bench
* head home
  * Jackie had dinner with Heidi
  * bread bowl at a cafe
* won a game of Slay the Spire!

LEARNINGS:
* car wash is still free at my favorite gas station
