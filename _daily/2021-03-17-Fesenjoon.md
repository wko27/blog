YESTERDAY:
* 2nd attempt at calling Schwab for support
  * way too many teams forwarding to each other
* eggs for breakfast
* leftover pizza for lunch
* took a nap
* Jackie and I decided to make a fesenjoon
  * it's a Middle Eastern pomegranate stew with chicken
  * way too sour xD
  * think we both got stomachaches since we're not used to the acidity
  * also made a fancy saffron rice with it
* passed out around 9
* parents got the Wyze and set it up all on their own!
  * so proud :D
* woke up around 11 for a few more hours
* back to sleep
