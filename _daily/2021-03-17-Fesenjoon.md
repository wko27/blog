YESTERDAY:
* 2nd attempt at calling Schwab for support
  * way too many teams forwarding to each other
* eggs for breakfast
* leftover pizza for lunch
* took a nap
* Jackie and I decided to make a fesenjoon
  * it's a Middle Eastern pomegranate stew with chicken
  * way too sour xD
  * think we both got stomachaches since we're not used to the acidity
  * also made a fancy saffron rice with it
* passed out around 9
* parents got the Wyze and set it up all on their own!
  * so proud :D
* woke up around 11 for a few more hours
* back to sleep

TODAY:
* 7:30 am early morning call
* frozen noodles for lunch
* more calls with Schwab
  * finally got through!
* attended a CMU builder session as an observer
* skirt steak for dinner
  * with secret spices from the butcher at the Mexican grocery store down the street
* gave my parents a call to confirm visit!
* took a nap at 10 pm
* finished season 1 (I think?) of demon slayer
* finally finished off

LEARNINGS:
* saffron rice is super tasty
  * also surprisingly little saffron required to make delicious
* that startup idea we had on employee monitoring has come to fruition
  * https://hbr.org/2019/08/better-ways-to-predict-whos-going-to-quit
  * super dangerous territory :(
