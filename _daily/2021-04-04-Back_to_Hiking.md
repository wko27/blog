YESTERDAY:
* guitar
* Jackie picked up Roger's deli sandwiches for lunch
* went on a lovely hike with Bernice, Brian, and our new beefy friend Angus
  * Palo Alto's foothills park is now open to non-residents!
  * was supposed to be a 3 mile hike, but ended up more like 7
  * surprisingly no back pain!
  * finished around 4 pm
* stretched it out
  * took a 2 hour nap
* tons of scallops for dinner
  * and some little tiny potatoes, Yukon Gold
* munching on a tangerine popsicle
* asked to write a letter of recommendation for permanent residence!

TODAY:
* woke up and did some work
* group order at Ike's for a picnic
  * Ike's was backed up, two people on shift until 11:30 am
* lovely picnic in San Mateo
  * Alan brought an alcohol-less wine for me :D
  * basically carbonated grape juice
* eyes were a bit itchy on the way home
* two hour nap
* sous-vide oxtail stew for dinner
  * holy cow, going to make it this way from now on
* tried a new game called 'It Takes Two'
  * pretty smooth graphics and gameplay
