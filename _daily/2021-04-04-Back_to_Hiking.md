YESTERDAY:
* guitar
* Jackie picked up Roger's deli sandwiches for lunch
* went on a lovely hike with Bernice, Brian, and our new beefy friend Angus
  * Palo Alto's foothills park is now open to non-residents!
  * was supposed to be a 3 mile hike, but ended up more like 7
  * surprisingly no back pain!
  * finished around 4 pm
* stretched it out
  * took a 2 hour nap
* tons of scallops for dinner
  * and some little tiny potatoes, Yukon Gold
* munching on a tangerine popsicle

TODAY:
* 

LEARNINGS:
* back pain not directly correlated with long hikes
