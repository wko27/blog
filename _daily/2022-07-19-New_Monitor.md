YESTERDAY:
* head to work
* workout session
  * deadlifts and isolation workouts for my left arm
* Jackie made NY strip steaks and tater tots!
  * tater tots were so-so, but the steak was delicious
* had a smoothie afterwards
* new monitor finally arrived!
  * works great, but m1 laptop was limiting to 30 fps at 4k resolution
  * found out the issue was the dongle
  * ordered a new dongle

TODAY:
* head to work
* Thorvald had to skip our usual event
  * watched Umbrella Academy with Jackie instead
* ordered from a new noodle soup place for dinner
  * pretty tasty!

LEARNINGS:
* Jackie cleans up around the house more when she doesn't work
