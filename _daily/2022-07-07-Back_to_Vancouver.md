YESTERDAY:

  * juggling all the tasks
* got a ride with Guille to the airport
* snacks for supper
* flight was pretty smooth
  * decided to watch Matrix Resurrection since it was free
  * terrible movie
  * plane landed about halfway through the film
  * no real desire to finish it ...
* picked up rental car from Avis
* head back to Jackie's dad's place
* met her couson Melissa

TODAY:

* drove home by myself since Jackie went to Granville Island
* productive day remotely
* took one nap
* helped Jackie's family prep dinner
  * Kevin is Melissa's husband and was bbq-ing ribeye
  * managed to salvage the ribeye
  * vegan cinnabun was tasty!
* rushed to a bachata lesson and social in Vancouver downtown
  * salsa studio
* lesson was pretty basic ...
  * all sensual moves
  * teacher was rather impatient
  * also very specific in how he wanted us to dance
  * needed to emphasize a stronger connection and using movement instead of just hands to lead
* social dancing was fun
  * ladies seemed surprised that the guy can do moves that don't require effort from her
* parking garage closed at 11 pm
  * arrived there at 11:05
  * had to call security to come open up
  * luckily an employee had a key and let us in
  * no need to pay $50 fine
* Jackie showed her mom a shoulder inversion
* had a super tasty peach and a fancy orange

LEARNINGS:
* definitely worse teachers than the one we had in the bay
