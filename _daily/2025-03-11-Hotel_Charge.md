YESTERDAY:
* head to work
* filed a complaint with Chase
  * basically, hotel website doesn't work in Chrome
  * after checkout, it redirects to an empty cart
  * I called them to ask if the reservation went through and the lady said it didn't
  * she asked me to try again
  * eventually I got it working on Safari
  * but they charged my credit card for 3 transactions on the same date for the same person
  * then their support team tried to refuse the refund
* bulgogi beef for lunch!
  * very tasty
  * not too saucy
  * also had a bunch of vegetables to balance out the crazy ribs from last night
* watched another episode of Severance
* takoyaki and curry udon for dinner!
  * accidentally ordered too much takoyaki

TODAY:
* head to work
* thai noodle soup for lunch
  * pretty tasty
  * thin noodles were actually quite filling
* caught up with Kofi
* head to dance studio
* last practice at the old dance studio :(
  * Kat came by for class though
* ended up staying a bit late chatting with Hector
