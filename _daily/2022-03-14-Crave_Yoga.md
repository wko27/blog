YESTERDAY:
* woke up kinda early
  * also daylight savings
* head to Crave Yoga
  * flexibility and balance are mostly there
  * back only felt slightly sketchy on two moves
* head home for tutoring
  * graph problems!
* Jackie made tomago for lunch
* couch arrived!
  * I suggested using floor sliders
  * the guy had to borrow my scissors to cut them
  * then he asked to borrow a flathead screwdriver to pop off some plastic parts (to install the sliders)
  * then he asked if I could heat up his lunch in my microwave ...
  * we're basically best friends now :D
* made a lovely smoothie
* took a nap
* bit of coding
* Jackie had a weird craving for Red Lobster
  * got seated pretty quickly
  * not bad ...

TODAY:
* head to work
  * soo many meetings
* head to workout
  * PR week was interesting
  * apparently I increased my squat by 20 kg?
* Jackie wasn't feeling too well
* dropped by HK Bistro on the way home
  * porride and chow fun
  * not as salty as it used to be

LEARNINGS:
* a "lobster tail" is actually most of the lobster (minus head, claws, and swimmerets)
  * in Asia, the lobster tail is just the tail ...
* HK Bistro closes at 9 pm now???
