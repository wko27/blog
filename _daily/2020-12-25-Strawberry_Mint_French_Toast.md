* Jackie woke up by 11:30 and made a tasty lunch
  * french toast with a strawberry salsa
  * we used Brian's fresh mint leaves for the salsa
* passed out for 3 hours
  * she claims there was no dairy in the french toast
* dropped off a gift for Kaya
* chili and stir-fried tong ho for dinner
  * stomache was super upset though afterwards
