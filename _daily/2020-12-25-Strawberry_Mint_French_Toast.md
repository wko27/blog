YESTERDAY:
* woke up at 9
  * couldn't go back to sleep
* Jackie woke up by 11:30 and made a tasty lunch
  * french toast with a strawberry salsa
  * we used Brian's fresh mint leaves for the salsa
* passed out for 3 hours
  * she claims there was no dairy in the french toast
* dropped off a gift for Kaya
* chili and stir-fried tong ho for dinner
  * stomache was super upset though afterwards
* spent 8 hours beating God's Trigger straight through
* got to sleep by 5:30 am

TODAY:
* woke up around 12:30 pm
* salmon + chili for lunch
  * way too heavy xD
  * but we needed to finish that salmon
* hosted a family virtual chat
  * success!
* crazy sneezy today
  * tried to nap to get rid of the sneezes
* couldn't find a restaurant with lobster for dinner
  * Jackie found a seafood boil in Sunnyvale instead
* ordered my new blender
  * and Jackie's birthday gift

LEARNINGS:
* Jackie realized my sneezing is likely from dust allergies since our neato died
