TODAY:
* work from home due to office closure
  * some maintenance work being done
* headed out to have lunch with Sunjay at a conference in San Jose
  * swanky property
  * food wasn't that bad honestly
  * although "Asian chicken salad" is always questionable
* recorded part of Sunjay's talk
  * phone died
* caught up with our friends from Zohr
* no nap :(
* drive home had very little traffic
* head to Brian's for dinner
  * Sichuan boiled fish with ... kale?
  * not too bad
  * shucked a few raw oysters
  * not worth the effort like crab/lobster
* played the volcano level of Robinson Crusoe
  * lost because on the last action, out of four mystery cards, we drew all creature cards
  * this immediately kills the Brian ...
* head home to watch finale of season 1 of Money Heist

LEARNINGS:
* Sunjay's debate skills live
