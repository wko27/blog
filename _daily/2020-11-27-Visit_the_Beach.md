YESTERDAY:
* grocery run in the morning to pick up a roast duck for lunch
* spent most of the day playing Gloomhaven Jaws of the Lion
* Jackie made a black pepper beef using sous vide NY strip steak
  * we used chicken broth which perhaps made the sauce not stick to the beef too well
* family zoom call!
* spent most of the night playing Gloomhaven as well ...

TODAY:
* leftovers for lunch
* finally got out the house to visit a beach!
  * nice drive on highway 1
* ordered a lobster for dinner :D
* ordered my sister's Christmas and birthday presents

LEARNINGS:
* need to breathe some fresh air and hike up a hill every so often
