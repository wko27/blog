* helped give feedback at a pitch night
* puzzled pint in the evening
* ordered food for Himalayan Kitchen for dinner
  * Jackie already ate at Google

TODAY:
* head to work
  * not too much traffic
* almost nobody at lunch
  * think they didn't make enough food though
* installers came to mount the TV at my dad's place
  * except they placed it at the top of the ceiling ...
* head to dinner with Brian and Yoo-yoo
* made a sichuan boiled fish
  * Brian prepped fresh clam linguini
