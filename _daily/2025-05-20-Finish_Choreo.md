YESTERDAY:
* head to work
* pork adobo for lunch
  * super heavy
* Thorvald cancelled
* head to dinner with Maggie and Mark
  * went to dish n dash
  * not to be confused with dish dash
  * although they share the same owner
* head home

TODAY:
* head to work
* soboro don for lunch
  * ground pork with eggs!
  * except I think I took a vegan variant by accident
* gave a talk
* interviewed a candidate
* head to dance practice
  * choreo is technically done!
* Jackie was still having chest pains
* dumplings for dinner

LEARNINGS:
* vegan pork isn't bad ... but it's not the same :(
