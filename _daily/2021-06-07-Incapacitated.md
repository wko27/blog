YESTERDAY:
* missed my car checkup appointment
  * q.q
* woke up around 11 am
* tried getting out of bed ~3 times
  * :( failed
  * ended up reading a book until ~3 pm
* took a pain reliever on an empty stomach
  * not a great idea
* finished leftover curry for lunch
* spent ~5 hours doing pain relief exercises?
* went for a walk
* Jackie tried to feed me a fermented cantaloupe
  * tasted awful
  * cleaned the taste out with cherries and a smooothie

TODAY:
* head to work
* weather's getting rather nice
* picked up wingstop for dinner
  * Jackie got an order of atomic wings
  * she suffered through it xD

LEARNINGS:
* apparently Jackie might be allergic to cantaloupe!
