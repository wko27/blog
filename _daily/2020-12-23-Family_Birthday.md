YESTERDAY:
* busy working
* noodles for lunch
  * had to take two naps though
  * think there was too much msg
* jackie did more deliveries
* jackie made crabcakes for dinner!
  * think I had ten

TODAY:
* dad's birthday!
  * had a lovely family call
  * met my sister's new boyfriend
  * set up an extended family call for Christmas day
* jackie made a delicious lemon crab pasta
* finally ordered a new blender
* watched Akira
  * ... not what I expected
* hm, found out that if I remove my pillow, my back hurts less during the day!
* also, raised my monitor by a few inches, seems to improve things

LEARNINGS:
* the blender competition is heating up!
  * didn't realize that Vitamix is made in USA
* maybe pillow raising my head is akin to looking down while standing up?
