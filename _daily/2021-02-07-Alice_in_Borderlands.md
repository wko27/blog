YESTERDAY:
* guitar lesson
* virtual hangout with the cousins
  * played codenames online
  * also tried fake artist
  * finally, my lack of artistic ability is a strength :D
* started watching Alice in Borderlands
* dropped by Whole Foods
  * picked up some korean bbq meatballs
  * also some vegan nutella
  * found a lot of cracked eggs
* picked up Noodle Talk for dinner
* tried out Ableton

TODAY:
* woke up close to noon
* burgers for lunch!
  * mesquite-flavored patties were very tasty
* laundry
* headed to Brian's to resume Gloomhaven
  * returned his aerogarden
  * farewell basil plant!
* made short ribs for dinner
  * and 'asian' vegetables :D

LEARNINGS:
* new neato is really cranky
  * turns out you can't just clean out the dust bin and set it off
  * there's a little button beneath the dust bin ...
