YESTERDAY:
* cranking on some code in the morning
* had a bowl of cereal for lunch
* head to working session
* talked for ~2 hours straight
  * feeling it in my vocal cords
* sous vide steak for dinner
  * boneless NY strip is way more juicy

TODAY:
* made a mac n cheese for lunch
  * amy sent it to us
  * seemed to taste like an authentic one?
  * very cheesy though
* quick dropoff at customer
* realized that Jackie set up her braces for Friday
  * worried that she can't eat steak afterwards, so we made another steak for dinner
  * 4 hours at 130F
* made another huge smoothie

LEARNINGS:
* realized that my soap may be causing Jackie some skin irritation
