TODAY:
* head to cafe for breakfast
  * acai was more liquidy than I'm used to!
* Jackie and I took an uber to the aquarium
  * located about 45 minutes from Condessa
  * entrance is inside of a mall!
  * had to ask a shop vendor for directions
  * secretive entrance ends up in a massive three story aquarium!
* kid-friendly museum with lots of interactive exhibits!
  * ticket seller said that the capybara interactive experience is unavailable today since they are new and shy
  * lemurs and tarantulas were pretty neat
  * tank seemed a bit small for the number of sea creatures in there!
  * capybara exhibit was outside by the flamingos and tortoises
  * turns out that you can pet the capybaras through the (relatively wide) bars of the enclosure
  * saw two tortoises fighting and two tortoises mating on the way out
  * so many kids on field trips
* wandered through the mall a bit looking for presents
  * started raining pretty hard
  * mall had certain rainforest areas that were open to the skies above
  * decided to wait out the rain before going outside to catch an uber back to AirBnB
  * Jackie found a relatively cheap Brazilian churrascaria
* waiter was very shy about his English
  * he did a great job of explaining everything though
  * chorizo was delicious!
  * brisket was also pretty tasty
* head back to Condessa through traffic
* hang out with Bernice
  * started playing a game called Monikers
  * ended up playing with Lea (Bernice's roommate) and Jesus (her love interest)
  * we played 3 vs 2 and Jackie and I destroyed them xD
* Jesus took us to a nice restaurant called Mux
  * took a fun bike ride to get there
  * little sketch biking without helmets through the rainy streets
  * cars were very patient though
  * mole had very complex flavors
  * tostadas were delicious with excellent chicken
  * so stuffed after this meal
* head back to take a shower and pack
