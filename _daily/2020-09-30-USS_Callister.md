YESTERDAY:
* finished our fake salmon (steelhead trout)
  * lemon garlic butter
  * pretty tasty!
* finished Last of Us 2
  * Santa Barbara enemies were completely pointless
  * nice finale though ...

TODAY:
* Jackie made a wedding card for Rae!
* sandwiches from Roger's Deli for lunch
* curry with sous vide beef for dinner
  * -_- realized that the curry we bought has a bit of milk in it
  * pretty tasty anyway!
* deathnote with Thorvald
* watched black mirror episode

LEARNINGS:
* milk! in japanese curries!
  * luckily it's the last item listed in the ingredients so it should be a small amount
