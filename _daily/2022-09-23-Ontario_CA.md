TODAY:
* packed all my stuff
* head to work
* tireside chat
* realized around 4:15 pm that I never checked-in to my flight
  * then I realized my flight left about an hour earlier than I expected
* got to airport about 40 mins before departure
  * Guille got a little lost trying to find terminal for Frontier
  * ran in there and agent said they already started boarding
  * lady at security let me use the priority lane when I said they were boarding
  * basically ran down terminal A getting to my flight (of course it was the gate at the very end)
  * got on with 5 mins to spare
* arrived on time
  * Amy and Dad got stuck in traffic trying to pick me up
  * apparently it took them 1.5 hours to get to the airport
* drove to a noodle shop for dinner afterwards
  * terrible navigating all the construction to get to the parking lot
  * delicious beef noodle soups though
* got home
* shower and sleep

LEARNINGS:
* check-in ... earlier
* also need to get that TSA pre-check back
