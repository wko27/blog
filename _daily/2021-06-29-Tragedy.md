YESTERDAY:
* woke up at 8:30 am
  * two missed calls from Amy and one from my aunt
  * found out my mom passed away
  * let my co-founder know
* found a flight for my sis
* drove to LA
  * Jackie took first half
  * stopped by Arby's for lunch
* very surreal
* spent time sitting with my dad
* made a list of things we have to do
* dinner with the aunties

TODAY:
* Jackie made breakfast
* my mom found so much joy in everything
  * found a draft email from her about pedestrians in SF vs NYC
* the problem is that I suspected that her stomach issues were actually hiding something serious
  * I had her promise to have it looked at it, and in return I would get my back fixed
* spent the day going through her contacts and preparing an obituary and farewell message
* cousins came over with food
  * so much food
  * family is amazing and supportive, super grateful
* aunties came by for dinner

LEARNINGS:
* cherish what you have and don't wait
