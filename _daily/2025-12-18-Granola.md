TODAY:
* head to work
* ramen for lunch
  * pretty tasty, but not as good as Satoshi
* head to yoga
  * working on side crow
  * haven't done this in a while
* head to Whole Foods
  * Simren needed me to order a lettered cake
  * apparently they need 48 hours of notice for any customization -_-
  * picked up some mushrooms and frozen veggies
  * went to Costco instead
  * easy form to fill out
* made a frittata at home
  * also two lo mai gai
* Jackie went to Tammy's to hang out

LEARNINGS:
* now that I've tasted Satoshi, all ramens pale in comparison
