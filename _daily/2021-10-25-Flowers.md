YESTERDAY:
* went to sleep late finishing a book
* breakfast with the aunties
* visit my auntie Loretta (she's recovering from a stroke)
  * she looks much better!
* dropped by cemetary to visit my mom
  * left a few flowers for grandpa and Stephanie too
* picked up my dad to try out a new restaurant with my dad
* late night game of chess with my dad
  * he was one pawn up mid-game and converted it to a win by the end
* Amy gave my dad access to her HBO
  * he started watching Game of Thrones

TODAY:
* ran standup from LA
* Jackie ordered food for lunch
* head to eastern part of LA for work
* Jackie and Dad picked up a roast duck for dinner!
  * had it with some noodles and veggies

LEARNINGS:

  * I had a headache after that game, too many complicated positions to work out
