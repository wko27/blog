YESTERDAY:
* tried to drop off MRI images to my doctor
  * seems like they had a communication fault
  * was given a phone number to call to request personal documents?
  * left my doctor an unhappy message
* head to work
* carbonara for lunch
  * ended up having an instant soba noodles instead
* cranked until 7 pm ish
  * got home late
* Jackie was running a toastmaster's contest
* made a fried rice with shrimp and kielbasa
* made a tasty smoothie

TODAY:
* MRI CD drop off round 2
* tasty onigiri for lunch!
* headed back a bit late
* gloomhaven at brian's!
  * finally retired my character
* taiwan noodles and soup dumplings for dinner
  * also had fun making sushi
* spent the night researching builds for the summoner

LEARNINGS:
* think I nailed what makes a smoothie good!
  * it's consistency, just blend it longer
