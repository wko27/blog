YESTERDAY:
* woke up around 9 am

  * crowded parking
  * neat church though!
* head to breakfast
  * had a massive burrito at Cafe Jose
  * delicious and not too expensive
  * started raining while we were eating
* decided against a wet hike
* headed towards hotel
  * then it started to clear up
* went past hotel to Montezuma Castle
  * this has nothing to do with the Aztecs
  * this is also not a castle
  * it's a village of caves on a cliff made by the Hopi tribe
  * apparently they were deserted mysteriously just before European settlers arrived
* head to a ramen place for dinner
  * ramen wasn't too bad
  * noodles were a bit undercooked
