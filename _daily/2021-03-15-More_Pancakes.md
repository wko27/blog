YESTERDAY:
* woke up around 1 pm
* pancakes for lunch!
* laundry
* headed to grocery store
  * took forever to find liquid smoke
  * $1.50 for a box of blueberries! super cheap
* ordered a Wyze for my parents
  * so they can watch the doves hatch an egg while visiting me
* made a pizza with Jackie
  * and some asparagus
* more demon slayer
* got to sleep by 3 am, not too bad

TODAY:
* woke up with this super vivid dream about an Eastern European couple selling me another Toyota
  * very weird ...
* pizza and octopus dumplings for lunch
* Jackie wanted to make patty melts for dinner
  * apparently she never had them before
  * pretty delicious, but super oily
  * also baked broccoli for dinner
* caught up with Becca and gave her some pointers on interviewing tactics
* ordered a Wyze for my parents
  * so they can monitor some dove eggs in their garden while visiting me

LEARNINGS:
* need to get more consistent sleeping
