YESTERDAY:

TODAY:
* head to work
  * brought all the dance stuffs
* tonkatsu for lunch
  * little heavy
* finished a bunch of things
* left work a bit early
* picked up Jackie and Vedant from a car shop in Burlingame
* ended up at the dance festival a bit early
* tech rehearsal was not so great
  * messed up my part in the center at the end
* practiced it out for the next few hours
* everything went smoothly for actual performance though
  * I made a small mistake, but you can't see it behind Jackie's legs
* late night food at Chingu
  * some really drunk people at the table behind us
  * ate way too much
* took Vedant and Christine back home
* got to sleep by 2 am?

LEARNINGS:
