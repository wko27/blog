YESTERDAY:
* running errands
  * picked up racing scales from SF
  * 70 lbs down a staircase
  * pickup from co-worker
  * almost ran out of gas
* found out using vehicle scales that I gained 10 lbs since COVID-19 started :(
* picked up Noodleosophy for dinner on the way home

TODAY:
* questioned my sanity for an hour
  * db record existed where it should not have
  * only way it could exist is if I ran reprocessing job the night before
  * but ... I don't remember doing so
* decided to take a break
  * downloaded Ghost of Tsushima!
  * pretty fun :)

LEARNINGS:
* whew, I need to start carrying more heavy things
