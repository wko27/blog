YESTERDAY:
* head to Float in Campbell
  * next to the open market in downtown
* Jackie's birthday present was a sensory deprivation tank experience!
  * kind of neat floating in the salt water
  * mind immediately started thinking of ways to control water flow to avoid human from bumping into surfaces
  * nose got itchy halfway through the float
  * went to scratch and saltwater got into my eyes q.q
  * luckily they had a little spritzer bottle to cleanse
  * took a nap for the rest
* head to dance auditions at Artista
  * salsa was fun
  * bachata was more fun
* took Mauricio to lunch at Jackie's place
  * parking lot was super full
  * pretty tasty but very heavy food
* dance practice with the team
  * fixed a few minor things
