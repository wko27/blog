YESTERDAY:
* head to work
  * Jackie came along  
* soups were a bit sad today
  * chicken wonton had no wontons
  * vegan orange chicken was so-so
  * broccoli beef was interesting
* left work a bit early to get a fancy haircut
  * haven't had my hair washed in a salon in ... decades
  * seemed like a decent cut
  * they had a cute dog that was yapping at us
* head home
* watched another episode of three body problem
* Jackie made some ... salmon parts
  * some of them were tasty!
  * lots of bones
* practice guitar

TODAY:
* head to work
* Jackie hung some stuff on the door
  * this'll be important later
* head to work
* cream of mushroom was delicious!
  * halibut was only so-so
* one nap
* head home
* Jackie called saying the door won't open
  * seemed jammed somehow
  * wasn't out of batteries since it lights up and we can hear the click
* head to bachata team practice
* called a locksmith on the way home
* figured out you can raise the lever instead of depressing to open
  * cancelled the locksmith
  * turns out the stuff she hung on the door caused the latch to partway open
* dropped off shoes at Abhigyan
* Tommy Thai for dinner!

LEARNINGS:
* don't hang things on my door!
