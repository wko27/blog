YESTERDAY:
* work from home
* made myself an egg with cereal for dinner
  * egg didn't turn out that well
  * need more practice
* dental appointment
  * used a neat dye to show me where the plaque lives
  * apparently I'm good at brushing my rears but not the fronts
  * also got this neat lip tape thing for mouth-breathing
* head to Subway for dinner
  * used some coupons
  * holy cow subs are expensive now!
* lost a game of chess to my dad

TODAY:
* head to work
* light workout in the gym
  * almost recovered from climbing
  * still only 3 pull-ups
* ordered from Fashion Wok for dinner
* mock interviews with Bernice
* caught up with Michael

LEARNINGS:
* my graphics card doesn't support DirectX 12 Feature set 12 :(
  * only feature set 11
  * also, you'd think Steam would be able to automatically check for compatibility
