YESTERDAY:
* head to work
* caught with an advisor and consultant
* head to dance practice
  * tried on our new performance shirts
  * has a weird buckle underneath so it stays tight
* did three practice runs with the other teams
  * got to see the other team's performances!
  * minor adjustments all around
* in-n-out afterwards
  * tried a 4x0 protein style
  * think I did this before and also regretted it back then ...

TODAY:
* head to work
* bit of sprinting
* 'argentinian food for lunch'
  * not authentic at all ...
* called about the custom pants delivery
  * was promised they would be ready mid-next week
* went to yoga class
  * good stretches
  * mat was a bit smelly though
* made some fried rice for dinner
  * had mapo tofu
  * also boiled two corn-on-the-cob
  * couldn't actually finish the last corn
* Jackie and Sara were at a Halsey concert
  * picked them up around 10 pm
  * tons of traffic
* took a shower with my yoga mat to clean it up
* worked a bit late until around 4 am
* lots of late night planning

LEARNINGS:
* 4x0 is too meaty and not enough sauce
