  * didn't realize they can scan your license nowadays :D
* holiday party!
  * great food
  * bulgogi beef, kalbi, and impossible burgers
  * heads-up
* presentation went smoothly
* hung out until 5 pm
* head home
  * little rainy
  * gave my dad a call
* figuring out offer amount!
  * exciting
  * it's like real-life monopoly

TODAY:
* head to work
* got one of the extra lunches
  * bulgogi beef wasn't as good as Costco's
* made an offer around noon
  * got it accepted in the late afternoon
  * paperwork
* head home early
* pack
* head to LA
  * dropped by Panda Express for dinner
  * some really inexperienced drivers on the road
  * dark, rainy conditions and still trying to be aggressive

LEARNINGS:
