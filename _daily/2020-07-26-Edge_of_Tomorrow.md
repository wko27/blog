YESTERDAY:

  * also fingers not working
* virtual meetup with Brian
* 2.5 hour nap by accident

* watched Edge of Tomorrow with Jackie
  * she liked it!
* made popcorn by myself (mostly)

TODAY:
* interview candidate no-show q.q

  * yam leaf, suprisingly tasty
* 1.5 hour nap
* laundry
* nob hlll and ranch 99 run
* cleaned up a bunch of documents
* filled my empty olive container with sesame oil
  * sesame oil dispenser was a terrible design, leaks everywhere
* new sponges!

LEARNINGS:
* good to clean every now and then
