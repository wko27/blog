* had a leftover sandwich from lunch for dinner
* got home around 2 am
* shower and sleep

TODAY:
* COVID test in Redwood City
  * necessary before my surgery
* need to pick up a ERAS kit?
  * apparently they sent me one a month ago which never arrived

* ended up working late
* forget what we had for dinner

LEARNINGS:
* drive-thru COVID tests are pretty straightforward
