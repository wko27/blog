  * or maybe appetite was reduced due to fiber pills
* food coma
* head to yoga!
  * I think my mat was too smelly
  * yoga instructor opened the door next to me to let in some air
  * but this meant half of my body was cooler during the practice :(
* Jackie made kalbi for dinner
  * super tasty
  * carrots were ... less so; bit too oily
* made a smoothie
* read a short story from Jessica's holiday present
  * sci fi author
  * neat story about parallel timelines ...
* replaced my bedroom curtains with a black fleece blanket
