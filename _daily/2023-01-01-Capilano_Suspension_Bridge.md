YESTERDAY:
* woke up rather late, after noon
* ate a rather delicious sweet potato for lunch
* head to Capilano Suspension Bridge
  * I didn't know this was actually a little theme park with a bridge focused on the bridge
  * pretty neat with treetop pathways and lots of nature
* picked up some fancy oranges for Jackie's mom
* drop by Deer Garden Signatures, a tasty noodle place
  * also picked up some cough drops from a pharmacy
* head home
  * leftovers for dinner
* peaceful new years eve with family

TODAY:
* woke up around 10
* head to dim sum!
  * massive lines, even with a reservation
  * delicious dim sum though
* drop by a golf store afterwards
  * Jackie's mom got into a bit of a verbal altercation with another driver
  * Costco was closed
* food coma nap at home
* enjoyed another amazing home-cooked meal by Jackie's mom
* ran an errand to drop off a gift to Jackie's mom's friend
  * cheese wheels, which I shall now call cheels
* enjoyed lychee and Korean strawberries
  * unfortunately we at the lychee first, so the strawberries tasted sour

LEARNINGS:
* a bunch of Cantonese phrases which I'll probably forget within a week :(
