YESTERDAY:
* woke up at 7 am
* drank a glass of water and the special grape cocktail in the ERAS kit
* worked on a fun side project until 9 am
* head to hospital in San Jose with Jackie
  * found parking
* Jackie had to leave me when I went down to the ward area
* super friendly nurse asking questions
  * another nurse pricked my finger for blood and attached the IV
  * curious if it was a psychological thing so I associate pain with a different nurse than the one asking questions
  * I did ask the nurse about this and she said it was just for efficiency
  * received Tylenol through IV and all my discomfort vanished
* met my surgeon, anaestheologist, nerve doctor, and the OR nurse
  * all super professional
* had fun peeing with an IV attached to my hand
  * pee smelled sulfuric, probably from the grape cocktail thing
* surgery itself was delayed by an hour (woman before me came late)
  * ended up people watching and checking out all the fancy tech
  * the "blanket" was like soft bubble wrap inflated with warm air, very light and easy to adjust
  * overhead lights had trees and clouds
  * ID bracelet had name, gender, QR code, and barcode
* finally got taken to operating room around 12:30 pm
  * 3 2 1 countdown and out was interesting
* woke up at 1:30 pm ish
  * had a super deep sleep with a dream that I don't recall
  * nurses were very kind
  * I was super chatty for some reason, and complimented the nurse on her eyebrows
  * Niti (my nurse) took 5 minutes to chat with an elderly lady next to me
  * I remember chiming up and saying that Niti was a great nurse, unprompted
  * sedation drugs are crazy!
  * tried to make friends with the elderly lady next to me
* surgeon confirmed I had a ruptured disc
  * said it shouldn't be an issue later ...
Jackie came by to visit around 3:30 pm
  * had to pee before they could discharge me
  * putting on clothes was fun
  * apparently I shouldn't have worn jeans (too tight)
  * wheelchaired me to the car
  * super bright sun outside and very warm
* didn't feel super nauseated until Jackie drove me home
  * Honda Civic suspension leaves something to be desired
  * did NOT throw up luckily
  * back felt ... hollow
* passed out for another 3 hours
  * woke up around 7 pm feeling awesome
  * no pain in my leg at all finally!!!!
  * having fun walking in circles around my tiny condo
  * Jackie made my chicken noodle soup
  * called a few folks to let them know I was fine

TODAY:
