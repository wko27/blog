* debated going to grocery store
* bit of work for several hours
* tried out a new braised short rib recipe
  * 2.5 hours of cooking :'(
* worked on wedding invitation stuff
* short ribs were delicious!
  * probably should have submerged my spices a bit more
  * also, little too acidic imo
* nuts for dessert
* sync with Brian
* caught up with Elle
* finished Alien Dark Descent

TODAY:
