YESTERDAY:
* woke up a bit early
* head to Kaiser for vaccinations
  * two shots in each arm
  * tensed on the 3rd shot :(
* also had to get three sets of pills from the pharmacy
  * one required refrigeration, so had to stop by home again
* bit late to work
* Frutti Di Mare for lunch
  * love the translation fruit of the sea
* cranking at work
  * listening to Yuja Wang
* head to workout
  * definitely pulled a lower back muscle doing deadlifts :(
* panda for dinner
  * new cashier had me scan the coupon like 5 times ...
  * didn't give me my discount :(
* head home
  * heat and stretching

TODAY:
* had to roll out of bed :(
* head to work
* curry udon for lunch!
  * super heavy
* took first nap
  * no back pain
* took second nap
  * mild stiffness and aching
* decided against climbing
* also decided against yoga for now ...
* dance practice with Jessica at Google HQ
  * back didn't hurt at all during dancing at least
* dropped by in-n-out for dinner
  * avoided fries since apparently fried food can cause inflammation?
* head home
* began packing for trip to Jackie!
* went to sleep without laying horizontally
  * stacking pillows

LEARNINGS:
* definitely pulled a back muscle back when I had my bouldering fall
  * probably a combo of pulling back muscle + popping my disc back then
* kept it active by stretching this time!
