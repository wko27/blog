YESTERDAY:
* woke up a bit late
* Jackie and I took a walk to the nearby farmer's market
  * Jackie got a bowl of crab mac n cheese
  * bought an acai bowl for lunch
  * not that sweet since they ran out of honey and agave
  * bought some mushrooms for Ann
* walked over to Hannah's birthday party event
  * at a local gymnastics center
  * so many kids
  * amazing to watch the staff line up the kids to enter the food place
  * Ann made a ridiculous lego dragon-themed vegan cake with grapes and strawberries
  * mango sticky rice was also excellent
* got everybody in the car to head back
* worked on a pikachu lego set for Johann
* Ann steamed a ling cod for an early dinner
* head back to downtown Seattle to depart on our train ride!
* got to the station earlier than needed
  * didn't realize we needed our passport to get manually checked
* beautiful views on the way up the coast
* got to Vancouver right on time

TODAY:
* woke up and head to work out of Jackie's dad's office
  * laptop wouldn't charge since he daisy-chained a bunch of power strips together
  * easy fix
* productive day
* Jackie's aunts maid made a tasty lunch
* finished around 6 pm
* quick nap
* head to rock climbing with Jerich and Shannon
* rock climbing section at the Olympic Oval isn't bad
  * very tall climbs though
  * went through belay certification
  * walls are inclined at the end and they require you to unclip the preset lines
  * avoids a huge swingout, but ... it's annoying to unclip on an incline when top-roping
* finished three climbs
  * got maybe 10% up the hardest climb on the wall
  * required some crazy arm extensions
* switched to bouldering for fun
* head to dinner
* malatang place was pretty tasty
  * also very packed for 10 pm on a Monday night

LEARNINGS:
* you can put shiitake mushrooms on a pizza??
