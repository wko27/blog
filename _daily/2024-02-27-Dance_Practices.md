YESTERDAY:
* head to work
  * listening to an NPR segment on Twitter
  * realized that the author of the book was my old yoga instructor from Medallia!
* chicken for lunch
* head to dance practice
  * good team practice
* in-n-out for dinner
* catch up with Jackie

TODAY:
* head to work
* spicy pork for lunch
  * not too spicy
  * japchae was tasty though!
* working a bit late
  * accidentally dropped a USB stick in the phone booth/privacy pod at work
  * spent a good 30 mins trying to fish it out
  * office admin had all sorts of neat ideas with a tape measure and sticky tape
  * gave up eventually
* head to another dance practice
* panda express open late!

LEARNINGS:
* hm, panda in San Jose doesn't give as much food
