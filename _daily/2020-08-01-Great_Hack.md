YESTERDAY:
* fried egg and leftovers for lunch
* spicy sichuan fish for dinner
  * everything was on fire
  * also called the parents
* watched the Great Hack documentary on Netflix
* fell asleep on the couch around 1 am

TODAY:
* woke up surprisingly refreshed
* guitar lesson
* eggs and kielbasa sausage for lunch
  * little heavy
* Fresco run!
  * meat vendor said they were out ... but I found a few packs
  * picked up 4 lbs of beef short ribs
* kalbi, corn, and veggies for dinner!
* amy's birthday gifts arrived
  * lovely cookbook and the odd assortment of things I can't actually wear
  * like a fanny pack that shows a hairy beer gut

LEARNINGS:
* kalbi is indeed better pan-fried than baked
  * super oily though
