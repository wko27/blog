YESTERDAY:
* fingers are still blue
  * doctor didn't seem too concerned?
* head to work
  * long morning meeting
* skipped ramen for lunch since we had some yesterday
  * got some breaded pork cutlet instead
  * very heavy
* nap
* more meetings
* met with Janet for PGSS mentor training
* met with Alfred for PGSS donation site handoff
* more work
* head to dance practice
  * huge korean k-pop group sharing the same space
  * showed everybody my fingers
* tricky ladies turns
* sync with Michael
* Jessica actually came over concerned about low blood oxygen levels
  * she let me borrow a ... pulse oximeter?
  * showed values from 95 to 97 which are low but not too concerning?

TODAY:
* head to work
* late bento box lunch
* exciting day!
  * figured out a really annoying bug
* met with Naman's co-founder for a brief chat
* caught up with Zhou
* ended up at Panda for dinner
* visited Alex and Charlotte
  * played Crew and Mad Gab with them for a bit
* head home
* tried not to work

LEARNINGS:
* blue finger nails are kinda weird!
  * suspecting some equipment that I brought back has cat hair triggering my asthma
  * or my mouth tape suggested by my dentist is reducing oxygen intake
