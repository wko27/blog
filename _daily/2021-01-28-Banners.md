YESTERDAY:

  * they signed up to get the vaccine!
* picked up Five Guys for dinner
  * lettuce wrap was messy

TODAY:
* held my morning plank for 2 minutes!
  * back to where we started :D
* hot pot beef pan-fried with kalbi sauce
  * wrapped in a burger bun for lunch
* curry katsu chicken for dinner!
  * almost messed up the curry
  * we had two curry mixes, golden curry and kokumaru
  * kokumaru actually has milk in it and gave me issues last time
  * golden curry was ... not the usual brick type, but instead a packet of pre-watered sauce
  * idea was to make two batches of curry; golden for me and kokumaru for Jackie, but ... there wasn't enough of one
  * ended up mixing them together
  * hope I don't feel terrible tonight!
  * Jackie got the katsu though
* called my parents again
* deployed a lovely banner
  * my best one yet!
