YESTERDAY:
* woke up at a normal time actually, around 9 am
  * think my sinuses finally cleared up
* tried to write down Jackie's family tree
  * lots of cousins
* head to the gym for a morning workout
  * they have a squat rack!
  * and a deadlift bar ...
* quick shower
* head to grandma's for breakfast
* delicious peanut-filled pan-fried sticky rice minicakes
  * also pork porridge and some very light fried noodles
* head to East hotel
  * send out Christmas letter
* head to Aeon Style again
* take laundry back to other hotel
* nap
* met up with everybody at Tai Koo station
  * head to Auntie Loretta's apartment in Kowloon
  * grandma got around in her wheelchair through the handicap lifts
* apparently the gap between the station and the train is a bit larger at certain stations
  * the caretaker requested the station to send somebody with a foldable ramp
  * they mark which train cab you embark on and wait on the other side for you to disembark
  * very handy for handicap folks!
* Christmas celebration at my auntie's apartment's club house area
  * saw a few family friends that I haven't seen in years
  * lots of tasty foods
  * apparently the cake we brought was one of four others ...
  * our cake got a little lopsided after travelling through the metro
* head back to main island
  * the lifts are kind of small
  * Jackie, Amy, and I got into a habit of taking the stairs/escalators instead
  * we wait by the lift exit and bow our heads to grandma as she departs as a joke
  * Jackie also says a welcome phrase that the vendors say at the mall
* got home and put away laundry

TODAY:
* head to a cha ta tang for pork chop rice
  * unfortunately, they didn't have pork chop rice
  * Amy came along and we had some tasty dishes though
* head back to hotel for a nap
* meet up with Amy at MTR station
  * picked up some onigiri
  * head to Shau Kei Wan
  * met up with Jackie's friend Shannon again
  * hop on a bus to the Dragon's Back trailhead
  * mild hike, 2.5 miles-ish
  * beautiful views of the ocean
* had some massive grapes as a snack
* helped some British folks take a picture
* finished hike in about 3 hours
* went to a place famous for peanut butter waffle with condensed milk
  * also passed a famous chain for char siu
  * ended up finishing half a pound of roast pork
  * Jackie also got the eggettes which took 30 minutes to make!
* head to a place for steampot
  * unfortunately, they didn't have steam pot
  * in my defense, Google search came up with the place and everything was in Chinese
  * still a delicious seafood meal though
  * crab was kind of a pain to pick apart
  * the waitress was pretty funny
  * they added rice at the end to make a delicious porridge
* found a mango pomelo sago restaurant a few blocks away
  * sadly, they do use milk in that dish
  * ended up with a mango sago with a coconut milk base instead of a mango + milk base
  * still pretty tasty
* went back to hotel super full

LEARNINGS:
* they have hikes in Hong Kong!
  * and the hikes are pretty darn easy
