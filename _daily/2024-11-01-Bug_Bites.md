YESTERDAY:
* head to work
* so many bug bites :'(
  * four on my knuckles are the worst!
* catching up on all the things
* skipped ramen for lunch
  * forget what I had instead
* pick up Jackie
* head home
* no dance practice!

TODAY:
* head to work
  * so many meetings
* Chinese chicken for lunch
  * bit spicy!
  * also no veggies
* picked up Jackie
* free dinner at Zoox!
  * not very impressed ...
  * super dry chicken
* head to SBK
* support dance teams
* head home

LEARNINGS:
* I've gotten pickier!
  * would usually never complain about free food
