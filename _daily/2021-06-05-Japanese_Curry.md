YESTERDAY:
* decided to work from home for once!
  * the one day I did it, somebody left a badge and couldn't get into the office xD
* leftover panda express for lunch
* accidentally interrupted Jackie in the midst of a meeting
* made a lovely chicken curry stew with Brian
* gloomhaven night!
* juicy details on Patreon
* watched an episode of agents of shield
* fixed up Becca's resume

TODAY:
* early morning sync
* lesson with Sara
* guitar lesson
* last of the leftover Panda express for lunch
  * Jackie had a meeting
* tried to go for an evening walk
  * had to turn around after a bit
* stayed up reading a book

LEARNINGS:
* curry chicken is better with big pieces of mushroom
  * it'll shrink anyway, and stay more flavorful
