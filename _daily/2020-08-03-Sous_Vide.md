YESTERDAY:
* jackie made pancakes for lunch!
* ranch 99 and nob hill run
* went for an actual run
  * Jackie can do almost half a mile without stopping now!
* pickup photos from CVS
* new sous vide machine was waiting for us on arrival!
  * so exciting
* put in our beef short ribs into a sous vide machine
* steamed a fish!
  * carp ... should not be steamed
  * curly fries
  * spinach stir-fry
* ice cream was re-frozen with ice particles everywhere

TODAY:
* head to garage
  * onboarding!
* burrito for lunch
* sadly found out that short ribs need 48 hours to cook
  * mapo tofu for dinner

LEARNINGS:
* way too many small bones in carp :(
* need to be more consistent with planks
