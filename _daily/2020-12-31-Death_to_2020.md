  * haven't been here in a while ...

  * funny but also sad

TODAY:

  * ended up working until 11
* leftovers for lunch
  * passed out until 3 pm
* laundry
* dropped by local grocery store
  * bananas for smoothies, and ox-tail + stew meat + leek
* more leftovers for dinner
* started making a delicious ox-tail stew
  * used a bunch of fresh herbs this time
  * seems super fragrant
* called parents for new years
* finished god's trigger
  * very fast-paced game
* made a huge smoothie
  * way too easy to make enough for two with this vitamix
