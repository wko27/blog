YESTERDAY:
* Jackie made a chili
  * but she ran out of cumin
  * so it tasted more like a marinara sauce with ground beef xD
* super hot today, but air quality was poor in Mountain View
  * can smell the air isn't quite right
* laundry
* cereal for lunch
  * Jackie finished pot roast leftovers
* chili for dinner
  * and roasted potatoes, mushrooms, and asparagus
  * we ran out of cumin though
* finished grapes for dessert
  * one green grape amongst the bunch of red ones
* organized a cousin gathering in December

TODAY:
* fried rice with sweet and sour pork for lunch
  * very heavy
  * beautiful day outside
* took a nap
* had a lovely chat with a CMU alumni at Apple
* homemade pasta with chili on top
* spinach went bad
* new fancy waterproof clock arrived
  * it syncs with an atomic clock supposedly
  * left it outside for 5 mins and didn't sync :(
* Jackie had a stomachache
* read a book
* reviewed some designs from Alex

LEARNINGS:
* chili without cumin is like a ground beef marinara
