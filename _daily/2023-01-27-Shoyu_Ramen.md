YESTERDAY:
* head to work
* shoyu ramen for lunch!
  * pork slices were very thin :(
* climbing with the gang!
  * new person Gloria joined
  * failed a ridiculous 11b with Chase
  * finished a crazy 10c ...
* dinner at Lopez - mexican place
  * caught up with Sara and Daniel
  * met her friend Dia
* lots of drama
* dropped off Louisa

TODAY:
* head to work
* busy day
* singaporean noodles for lunch!
  * better than the 'dim sum' option
* missed workout for a tireside chat
* dropped off Cecilia at 10 butchers
  * Tett asked "how's 10 butchers going" and we all heard "how's temperature going"
* head to Brian's
* brought blueberries
  * Brian made taiwan pork over rice
  * Marina and Joe were there too
* spirit island!
  * finished around midnight

LEARNINGS:
* 10 butchers and temperatures sounds very similar
