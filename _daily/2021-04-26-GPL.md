YESTERDAY:
* read up on how GPL and LGPL works
* took jackie on a yarn quest
  * went to Amazing Yarn, a shop hidden in the hills of Belmont
* lunch at Isarn Garden Thai
  * pretty tasty
* dropped by Michael's for Jackie
* headed home
* Jackie started making my mom some slippers!
* realized that we never put the groceries away from last night!
  * decided not to risk it with the beef
* forget what we had for dinner :(

TODAY:
* head to work
* lovely day
* Ranch 99 on the way home
  * picked up hot pot soup base
* hot pot
  * way more spicy than expected
  * first one without beef in a while

LEARNINGS:
* if I understood it correctly, the tldr is:
  * GPL says that if you modify library X and then release software Y that includes it; then you are required to reveal the source code of Y to the users
  * LGPL says that if you modify library X then release software Y that includes it, then you are required to reveal the source code of the modified library X to those users
