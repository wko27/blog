YESTERDAY:
* head to yoga
  * lovely class
* came back to shower
* Abhigyan called me
  * car troubles at Target!
  * apparently he locked his keys in the trunk
* head over with Jackie
* used AAA to request help
  * turns out the anti-theft is quite strong with 2021 Camrys ...
  * if you pop the lock through the window, it doesn't let you release the trunk from the driver's side
  * can't go through the back seats since the folding mechanism is triggered from the trunk
  * ended up calling a locksmith who knew how to uninstall the driver's side door lock
  * he then hits the button on the lock to manually unlock the car, bypassing the anti-theft
  * that locksmith was ... suspiciously proficient
* inchin for lunch
* head to dance practice
* productive practice!
* also a productive PGSS board meeting
* tried a new food truck that just opened up nearby
* head home
* bit of overcooked
* started working on the ballot
  * so many props
