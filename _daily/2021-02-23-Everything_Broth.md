TODAY:

* nap
* lovely interview
* grocery shopping at Hankook and Lucky's
* steamed a tilapia for dinner
  * gailan on the side
* Jackie was sad that my freezer had so many bags of bones waiting to be turned into stew
  * she decided to toss them all into a pot to make one stew to rule them all
  * pork bones, chicken bones, beef bones, duck bones ...
* found part of our metal strainer had a wire poking out
  * pliers to the rescue
* replaced a lightbulb in the kitchen
 
LEARNINGS:
* duck flavor beats all the other meats in the pot
