  * defeated Stockfish level 5!
  * lost narrowly to level 6
* Jackie had an anime movie night with her friends

  * baking soda trick worked!
  * ran out of oyster sauce though
  * substituting with hoisin and soy sauce was ... so-so
* watched an episode of cells at work black

TODAY:
* woke up super late
  * slept for like 9 hours
  * back felt fantastic though
* Jackie was notified that she needs to move out by end of the month!
  * totally expected
