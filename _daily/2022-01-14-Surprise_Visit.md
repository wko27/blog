YESTERDAY:
* head to work
* work out
  * first time doing a bench press since high school days
  * 3-rep max at 100 lbs?
* ramen dinner with a few friends
  * wandering around downtown mountain view at night was nice
* felt surprisingly awake, probably due to workout
* Jackie gave her mom a call
* turns out she'll be in town for the next week, surprise!
  * lots of planning
* found a neat app called floorplanner to help figure out what furniture to get for my dad

TODAY:
* ok that was a busy day
* Jackie called my coworkers trying to tell me
  * one of our friends we had dinner with tested positive for COVID
* so many meetings q.q
* super productive though
* cancelled dinner with Brian to meet with Jackie's mom
  * turns out Jackie's mom's boyfriend speaks mandarin but understands Cantonese
  * since I only speak English but understand Cantonese, we had some fun communication
* food coma'd early
* woke up at 4 am and caught up on some stuff

LEARNINGS:
* sometimes, things work out :)
