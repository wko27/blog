YESTERDAY:
* head to work
* korean food for lunch!
  * I think the staff was celebrating new tenants in the office space
* I had requested a consultation with a spine specialist
  * had an hour-long discussion with him
  * seemed very focused on suggesting temporary measures (painkillers, epidural steroid injections)
  * didn't seem that interested in surgery options
* caught up with Thorvald
  * finished Falcon and the Winter Soldier
  * little disappointed that it was only 6 episodes
* spent two hours composing a reply to the doctor
  * he sent me 4 articles on pain management including ... 'meditation techniques to manage pain'
  * ended up requesting consultation with a surgeon just to round out my options
* fell asleep by 2 am

TODAY:
* head to work
* katsu curry for lunch!
* scheduled an x-ray in preparation for surgeon consultation
* helped out a CMU alumni
* Jackie went for a long walk
  * apparently her team has another fitness challenge!
* caught up with Salil!
* headed home
* Safeway chicken for dinner
  * had some cereal later too

LEARNINGS:
* there's a difference between sets and arrays in SQL
  * apparently `WHERE x NOT IN (1, 2, 3)` uses a set
  * the equivalent with a list is `WHERE x <> ALL(1, 2, 3)`
* how NFTs work
