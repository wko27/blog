* Jackie ordered ramen for lunch
  * went to pick it up, so excited!
  * :( such tiny portions, pho is more worth it for delivery
* supposed to walk with Chetan
  * cancelled :(
* spicy boiled fish for dinner
* played two games of a Sherlock Holmes mystery game
  * each one took 3 hours and filled up my entire whiteboard

TODAY:
