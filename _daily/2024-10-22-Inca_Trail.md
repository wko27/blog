YESTERDAY:
* woke up at 3:30 am
* packed everything to go
  * Jackie still not feeling well
* picked up by bus to head down to Ollantaytambo
  * this little town is only at 2800 m elevation (500 m lower than Cusco)
* guide tour recommended that we stay at a local hotel
  * they will schedule other activities for us since we can not do the Inca Trail
  * had a bit of confusion with payment to the hotel
  * apparently the tour company has a discounted rate for travelers that have to turn back
* Jackie's headaches started subsiding within an hour
* head to town square
  * found a little cafe that made honey pancakes with fruit
  * walked around a bit to see some sights and restaurants
  * hung out back at the hotel by a comfy hammock
* head back out for lunch
  * dropped by the tourist attraction and its nearby market
  * there's an Incan ruin with terraces at the top
* lunch at a restaurant overlooking the square
  * local trout was tasty, although a bit oversalted
  * local quinoa soup was very soothing
* head back to hotel
  * I checked emails
* played a bit of chess
* massive afternoon nap
