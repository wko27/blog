  * very warm
* fixed a toilet
  * cleaned up patio

TODAY:
* head to work
* trainer cancelled our session
* went home early ish instead
* oxtail soup for dinner!
  * fantastic texture
  * I think this was due to better temperature control

LEARNINGS:
* do NOT let it rapid boil, keep it just at a simmer
