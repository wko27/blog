YESTERDAY:
* work work work
* leftovers for lunch
* wrote two rejection emails :(
* head to brian's for dinner
* climbed up a chair to reach a glass
  * chair was imbalanced and fell over while I was standing on it
  * bruised my shin pretty hard
* ate some smoked gouda sausage by accident
  * indigestion q.q
  * but the pesto risotto was tasty!
* researched more remedies for herniated discs

TODAY:
* woke up at 5:30 am
  * couldn't fall back asleep
  * built a neat feature
* guitar
* ordered sushi for lunch
* ran out of quarters for laundry
* took a nap while waiting for Jackie to finish a toastmaster's event
  * ended up sleeping for 3 hours by accident xD
  * allergies are almost clear!
* took jackie to pick up her honda from the dealership
  * they locked her keys in the car, so we had to return home to pick up spare keys
  * 2nd attempted pick-up was successful!
  * Jackie went off to get mochi donuts while I headed out for groceries
* went to Nob Hill grocerey store
  * asked the cashier if I could exchange for $5 of quarters
  * think she was pretty new, so she asked me to pay like usual with credit card
  * that didn't work, so I gave her $5 in ones to exchange via cash
  * customer line was growing behind me
  * she only had $10 rolls of quarters, so I gave her $20 instead
  * she returned $4 to me, so I had to ask for another $1 back ...
  * bagger bagged half my items into a brown paper bag and left the rest for me to self-bag in the cart
  * I headed to the corner to bag and finished
  * the customer behind me apparently wasn't used to having to self-bag
  * she also didn't have a cart and didn't have space to bag properly
  * so I finished bagging my groceries and left the cart behind for her to use
  * on my way out, the paper bag handles broke -_-
  * ended up nestling the broken bag in my arms out to the car
* on the bright side, Ranch 99 has re-stocked on the frozen lo mai gai!
* steamed a tilapia at home
  * used the lower steaming rack by accident
  * half of my fish was boiled instead of steamed :'(
* set up an appointment with a chiropractor

LEARNINGS:
* errands are so fun
