YESTERDAY:
* woke up
* head to yoga
  * empty class?
  * super packed at the same time the other weekend ...
  * performed my first tripod handstand since back surgery
  * going up was fine, but kinda bonked my head on the way down through crow pose
* ordered filipino food from Isla in Newark
* quick shower
* head out to pick up food
* helped host Jackie's engaging farewell party!
* caught up with lots of friends
  * discovered some juicy secrets
  * Aasmund visited from out-of-town
* leftovers for dinner
* left my dad half a vegan cupcake
* more wedding planning

TODAY:
* morning climbing with Louisa
  * saw a very impressive girl finish a 12d
* noodle talk for lunch!
* dropped off bananas and oranges to my dad
* left my car at the garage
* added registration sticker to WHAK
* got a ride from my dad to the airport
* fly to philly!
* flight got delayed by an hour
  * however, frontier requires baggage to be checked in 45 minutes before scheduled boarding regardless of delays
  * some confusion at the ticket counter since somehow our reservation was broken up into two flights
  * they made me pay an extra $80 for baggage to travel from Vegas to Philly
  * will definitely be disputing that via my credit card ...
* got to vegas
  * all the water fountains are broken
  * got a burger from Chili's
  * saddest thing ever
  * slightly better than Jackie's chicken tenders though
* boarding started at 10:27 pm, flight departs at 10:30 pm and they didn't post any delays?
  * read a book most of the flight
  * lady on our right kept coughing :(

LEARNINGS:
* don't check bags through frontier
