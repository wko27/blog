YESTERDAY:
* head to work
* gave Bernice a mock design interview
* headed home just in time for puzzled pint!
  * tricky puzzles today!
  * or maybe we were all just tired from work
* ordered sushi for dinner afterwards

TODAY:
* head to work
* mac n cheese for lunch
  * gave my part to Sunjay
* so many meetings q.q
* Jackie picked up noodles for dinner
  * and a happy meal :D
* watched two episodes of What If with Thorvald
* worked late into the night
* helped Jackie with some yoga poses and stretches
  * still got my crow pose

LEARNINGS:
* left ankle flexibility seems to be reduced
  * might actually be from the kneeling chair ...
