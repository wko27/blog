YESTERDAY:
* head to work
* busy day!
* chicken with lime for lunch
  * not the most tasty
* few naps
* head to yoga
  * haven't done yoga in a week-ish
* head home
* ordered chick-n-tea for dinner
* watched two more episodes of Andor with Thorvald
  * only two more to go!
* delicious mangos for dessert

TODAY:
* head to work
* chicken vindaloo for lunch
  * chef said that only the naan had dairy
* head to dance practice with Maggie
  * got the team to wear chicken feet socks!
  * Hector was so confused
  * did one song for a birthday dance
* practice was fun
  * hard to act serious wearing these socks though
* Maggie gave us a ride home
  * dumplings for dinner

LEARNINGS:
* glad folks appreciate my sense of humor with the socks
